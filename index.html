    <h1>So, what's happening?</h1>
    <p>I am currently rebuilding my website. That's why it looks plain right now.</p>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>What I had before not only looked terrible, it was neglected for four years. I might as well rebuild the whole thing to reflect what I do nowadays.</p>
    <h1>When will the new site be ready?</h1>
    <p>It will be ready whenever I think it's ready.</p>
