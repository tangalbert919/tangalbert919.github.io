        <p>Welcome to my new website. My old website can be found <a href="https://darknesgaming.github.io">here.</a></p>
        <p>I am the creator of <a href="https://www.github.com/DarknesGaming">DarknesGaming</a>, and I made it because I wanted to learn more about GitHub and get comfortable with it. I wanted to make it my primary account, but since it had no name associated with it, nobody out there would see my work. Colleges wouldn't be able to find my work very easily.</p>
        <p>A bunch of my projects on that old account can still be accessed, but please note that I won't use my old account to keep working on them. I will fork those projects and work on them on my primary account, which is my new account. If you want to see my projects, you can go to the projects tab on this website.</p>
        <p>Most of these projects, I do them for fun and learn new stuff while I'm at it. You can check them out either at my <a href="https://www.github.com/tangalbert919">account </a>or at my <a href="https://www.github.com/DarknesGaming">old account</a>.</p>
