## Google OTA Prober

This prober allows you to download updates for any Android device with just a build fingerprint. As long as that device is using Google's update services, you can download an update for it, provided that Google has an update available.

This was a fun project that I worked on last year, but it was command-line only. There were some improvements that I made earlier this year, but now there's a graphical interface available. It's still a work-in-progress, and I expect to have this completed by January of 2025. For now, this is what it looks like:

You can download the project [here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/google-ota-prober). Instructions on how to use the project can be found in the README document. How I managed to build the project can be found in my blog once I have it uploaded.
