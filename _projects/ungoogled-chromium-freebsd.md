## Ungoogled-chromium for FreeBSD

This is an attempt to port Ungoogled-chromium to FreeBSD (and by extension, any BSD distro based on that).

This project is reliant on ungoogled-chromium having patches for the latest version of Chromium, which can take
a few days to update. As such, do not expect this port to be updated on the same day Chromium is updated.
You can check out the work [here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/ungoogled-chromium-freebsd).
